# graphs-library

A library of functions use to traverse a graph and extract useful information from it. Functions using depth first search (DFS) and breadth first search (BFS) are available. Run the examples in the `/src/examples` folder to see the functions in action.

### Function for the following tasks are included:

- find all paths from a source vertex to a destination vertex (choose from functions that use BFS, recursive DFS or iterative DFS)
- find shortest path or least costly path using Dijkstra's algorithm
